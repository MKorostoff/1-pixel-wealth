# Translations and Adaptations

This page has been translated by volunteers into ten languages that I know of. I am not directly involved with any of these translations, and I don't speak any of these languages, so I can't promise they are accurate. If you'd like to create a translation, see [instructions here](https://github.com/MKorostoff/1-pixel-wealth/issues/8#issuecomment-622964168).  Once you've finished, provide a link in the [issue queue](https://github.com/MKorostoff/1-pixel-wealth/issues/new) and I'll update this readme.
